Text-Format-Lisp version 0.0.1

This is a Perl analog of the Common Lisp (format) command. It resembles the perl
sprintf() function if you squint and look at it sideways. In general, where the
format spec looks for nil, the perl version provides undef. Where it looks
for a list, perl provides an array. Basically the module is an excuse to
implement some of the more interesting features of the CL format function.

There are a few points where the two implementations will deviate out of
necessity, but other than that I try to keep to the spirit of the CL spec.

This should remain pure perl. If I ever get to the point where I have enough
time on my hands to convert this to XS I obviously will have other issues in
my life.
